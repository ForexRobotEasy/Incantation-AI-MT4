## Features

- Stop Loss and Take Profit: The expert advisor allows you to set the stop loss and take profit levels in pips.
- Risk Management: You can define the risk percentage per trade to calculate the lot size.
- Magic Number: Each trade opened by the expert advisor is identified with a unique magic number.
- Slippage Control: You can specify the maximum allowed slippage in pips.
- Trade Opportunity Conditions: You can add your own trade opportunity conditions based on specific indicators or patterns.

## How It Works

The expert advisor works by checking for new trade opportunities in the `OnTick()` function. If a new trade opportunity is identified, the `OpenTrade()` function is called to open a trade based on the sniper entry system.

In the `OpenTrade()` function, the lot size is calculated based on the risk percentage, account balance, stop loss, and market tick value. The stop loss and take profit levels are set based on the current bid price and the defined stop loss and take profit values.

A buy trade is then opened using the `OrderSend()` function. The function takes various parameters such as symbol, trade type, lot size, entry price, slippage, stop loss level, take profit level, trade comment, magic number, and color for visualization.

If the trade is executed successfully, the ticket number is printed. Otherwise, the error code is printed to indicate the failure to place the trade.

The expert advisor also includes an initialization function `OnInit()` and a deinitialization function `OnDeinit()` to attach and detach the EA from charts and timeframes.
